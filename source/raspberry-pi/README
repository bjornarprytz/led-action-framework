SCRIPTS (for RaspberryPi)

**** rpi_init.sh ****
This script is meant to be run locally on the RaspberiPi. It starts the python
scripts listener.py and server.py. It saves the output in respective .log
files, which are overwritten each time rpi_init.sh is run.

**** rpi_kill.sh ****
Kills the processes started by rpi_init.sh.

**** config.sh ****
Contains information on the various devices that the scripts need to run.

**** mapport.sh ****
Maps a port on the localhost (NUC) to a port on the RaspberryPi which server.py
can post to.

**** rpi_update.sh ****
Copies the necessary files from this folder to the RaspberryPi with secure copy

**** boot_script.sh ****
Calls rpi_update.sh and mapport.sh.

PYTHON

**** list_ports.py ****
lists all the "active" Serial Ports on the device.

**** listener.py ****
periodically requests stats from the Arduino, and updates the database in 'db/'.
It also calls functions from plot.py

**** logger.py ****
Creates JSON from the database periodically. JSON is used for the visual presentation.

**** plot.py ****
queries the database outputs aggregated data in json format to
'static/assets/'.

**** arduinoPi.py ****
Contains the communication protocol between Arduino and RaspberryPi
across Serial. It specifies the packet format and functions for requesting
the various data points.

**** RPicontrol.py ****
Handles the interface between the Arduino and the database. Uses arduinoPi.py to
as an API for the sensor data.

**** server.py ****
Serves HTML which presents JSON files containing the logged data from the Arduino
and its sensors.

**** database.py ****
Contains code for initiating new databases, and querying them. Implemented with sqlite3

**** day_night_cycle.py ****
Adjusts LED lights gradually up to 25% intensity at 8 AM, and down again at 10 PM
Meant to be run in the background like this:
nohup python day_night_cycle.py > "cycle.log" 2>&1 &

****
run_continuous.py
search_led.py
run_batch.py
****
Runs parameterized experiments on the enclosure. These should only serve as examples, and new ones
should be made for each specific experiment.

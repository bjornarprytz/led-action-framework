SCRIPTS (for RaspberryPi)

**** rpi_init.sh ****
This script is meant to be run locally on the RaspberiPi. It starts the python
scripts listener.py and server.py. It saves the output in respective .log
files, which are overwritten each time rpi_init.sh is run.

**** rpi_kill.sh ****
Kills the processes started by rpi_init.sh.

**** config.sh ****
Contains information on the various devices that the scripts need to run.

**** mapport.sh ****
Maps a port on the localhost (NUC) to a port on the RaspberryPi (as yet,
I haven't found a port to use besides 80).

**** rpi_update.sh ****
Copies this folder to the RaspberryPi with secure copy


PYTHON

**** list_ports.py ****
lists all the "active" Serial Ports on the device.

**** listener.py ****
periodically requests stats from the Arduino, and updates the database in 'db/'.
It also calls functions from plot.py

**** plot.py ****
queries the database outputs aggregated data in json format to
'static/assets/'.

**** RPiserial.py ****
Contains the communication protocol between Arduino and RaspberryPi
across Serial. It specifies the packet format and functions for requesting
the various data points.

**** server.py ****
Serves JSON files containing the logged data from the Arduino and its
sensors.
